#R2DBC with Spring Data
This repository demonstrates how to use R2DBC (Reactive Relational Database Connectivity) with Spring Data. R2DBC is a powerful API that enables non-blocking and reactive database access, while Spring Data provides a convenient way to interact with databases in a Spring application.


##Motivation
R2DBC was created to address the need for a non-blocking application stack that can handle concurrency efficiently with a small number of threads and scale. Traditional blocking APIs like JDBC are not suitable for these scenarios. Reactive programming with R2DBC allows applications to perform non-blocking, asynchronous database operations, leading to better scalability and resource utilization.


##Motivation
In this repository, you'll find examples that show how to work with databases using R2DBC and Spring Data. These examples cover tasks like adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting data (CRUD operations), searching for specific information (querying). To explore these examples in detail, please check the code.
